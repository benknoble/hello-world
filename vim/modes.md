# Modes
## (aka) How to Work in Vim

There are four primary modes in Vim:

* Normal
* Insert
* Visual
* Replace

### Normal

In Normal mode, typed characters are commands (like a motion or delete).
It is also used primarily for moving around.

The default mode is Normal.

### Insert

In Insert mode, typed characters are inserted directly into the text
where the cursor is. You can temporarily suspend an insert by typing `<Ctrl-O>`,
during which you can enter _one_ Normal mode command.

To enter Insert mode, type the character 'i' while in Normal mode.
To exit insert mode, pres `<Esc>`.

### Visual

### Replace
