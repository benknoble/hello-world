Saturday morning jumped out of bed and onto the sidewalk
Got on the bus and raced like a jet, too many blocks
Knocked on your door with forks in my hand
To ask you a question
Cause I know that you're a well-off man

Can I have a meal with you and your wife? say yes, say yes
Cause I need some food
You say I'll never eat with you but today I might die
Tough luck my friend but the answer is no!

Why you gotta waste your food?
Other people want some too!
Why you gotta waste your food?
You better eat it all anyway
Eat all that food
Eat it all anyway
Eat all that food
Yeah no matter what you say
Eat all that food
Clean off that dirty plate

Why you gotta waste your food?

I hate to do this, you leave no choice
I can't watch you trash it
Pray and listen to that small voice
Leftover food bits
Or we will take away
All of that wasted food you know
You know you take from me
All you ever do is tell me no

Can I have a meal with you and your wife? say yes, say yes
Cause I need some food
You say I'll never eat with you but today I might die
Tough luck my friend but the answer's still no!

Why you gotta waste your food?
Other people want some too!
Why you gotta waste your food?
You better eat it all anyway
Eat all that food
Eat it all anyway
Eat all that food
Yeah no matter what you say
Eat all that food
Clean off that dirty plate

Why you gotta waste your food?

Why you gotta waste your food?
Other people want some too!
Why you gotta waste your food?
You better eat it all anyway
Eat all that food
Eat it all anyway
Eat all that food
Yeah no matter what you say
Eat all that food
Clean off that dirty plate

Why you gotta waste your food?
