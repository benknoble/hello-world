A short poem I wrote as an experiment in AP English IV

---

Ignorance Isn't Bliss.

Stars, drifting silently across the
Sky, dark against a field of
Stars, brightly glowing around the
Moon, a pale face.

Shadows, reaching up like
Trees, around the edges of the
Sky, asleep like
Humans, ignorant of beauty.

Cars, racing by with noisy
Engines, powering countless bright
Lights, drowning out all the
Stars, bright lives.

Dawn, chasing slowly the
Night, tinged with pink ribbons of
Light, awakening tired
Humans, ignorant of beauty.

Clouds, drifting across a sleepy
Sky, awake with songs of
Birds, building nests from
Nature, true beauty.
